SUPERVISED LEARNING PROJECT

The project involves three main steps: exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, and training a machine learning model. These steps are essential for building a supervised learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

During exploratory data analysis, we will import the diabetes dataset and examine its structure, data types, and summary statistics. Through visualizations and correlation analysis, we will gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and potential outliers in the data.

In the preprocessing and feature engineering step, we will handle missing values and outliers in the dataset. This may involve imputing missing values or removing rows/columns with missing data, as well as identifying and addressing outliers. Additionally, we will split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Finally, in the training phase, we will use the prepared dataset to train a supervised learning model. The model will learn patterns and relationships between the diagnostic measurements and the presence or absence of diabetes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy will be used to assess the model's performance and determine its effectiveness in predicting diabetes.

Followed these steps :

1)	Importing the necessary libraries:
2)	Loading the dataset using pandas
3)	Used Matplotlib to make a couple of viz to detect outliers
4)	Removed the outliers from Glucose and Insulin 
5)	Pre-processed the data using Scaler Standard to fit and standardize the dataframe
6)	Split the data into Train and Test
7)	Used Linear model using SVM Classifier
8)	Checked for accuracy of the model
9)	Made a predictive system
